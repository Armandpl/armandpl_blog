I might write a more detailed version of this story later but in the meantime :
- I was 13, I stumbled upon a youtube video of a guy demoing a cool minecraft cheat mod.
- I spotted his email on the video, sent him an email asking if he could teach me how build a minecraft cheat mod.
- He taught me how to code ! Over the course of several months/years !
- I built my cheat mod and later merged it with his. We released it for free.
- This other guy did a youtube review that got [250k+ views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A08b88tbsAM){:target="_blank"}.
- We got a bunch of downloads. To this day I haven't written another piece of code that is used by that much people.
