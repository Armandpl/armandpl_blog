When I was 14, in 2013, I built a smart lock. I used a Raspberry Pi with a web server to drive the servo and receive the open/close requests. I used a windows software I can't remember to recognize my voice and send requests to the server on the Rapsberry Pi. I also wrote a tutorial on how to build it on a forum (which unfortunaltely went down). Here is the demo !
