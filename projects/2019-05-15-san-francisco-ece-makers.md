In January 2019 I participated in a program called "ECE Makers" proposed by my school. I went to San Francisco with 30 of my schoolmates.

The aim of the program was to have us organize an art exhibit. We had to create the art pieces ourselves, organize the space, and promote the event. We were introduced to the Silicon Valley mindset, we attended events such as Hello Tomorrow and pitch nights. We also had access to a giant maker space, TheShop, and were taught MIG welding, 3D printing, laser cutting, metalwork, and basic electronics.

Here is what my group came up with :

Each of these heads represents a different character with a different personality. They are all connected by pulsating strips of lights. Each pulse represents a 'communication'. Since they are different they communicate in different ways, at a different rate. When they all manage to communicate at the same time it creates a 'breakthrough' and the pulse of light [goes to the ceiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bMJ5EijWXs){:target="_blank"}.
