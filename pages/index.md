Hi, my name is Armand du Parc Locmaria. I am a soon to be software engineer studying engineering at ECE Paris. I am currently looking for a Spring 2021 internship.  

I like building, whether that's software or hardware. These days I'm trying to work out how to do that publicly.  

Feel free to [reach out](/contact) !
