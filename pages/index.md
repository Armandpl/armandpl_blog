Hi, my name is Armand du Parc Locmaria. I am an aspiring software engineer currently studying at [ECE Paris](https://www.ece.fr/ecole-ingenieur/). **I am currently searching for a Spring 2021 internship.**

I like building, whether that's [software](/projects/cng-mods), [physical stuff](/projects/jewelry-making.html) or more generally [products](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/draft-2faab89a-3e8d-4d42-ada3-73d69511104f){:target="_blank"}. I am currently interested in learning how to build and sell products. I find the IndieHacker philosophy appealing.

I also enjoy learning new technical concepts and technologies by working on professional projects.

Feel free to [reach out](/contact) !
