Hi, my name is Armand du Parc Locmaria. I am an aspiring software engineer studying at [ECE Paris](https://www.ece.fr/ecole-ingenieur/).

I like building, whether that's [software](/projects/cng-mods), [physical stuff](/projects/jewelry-making.html) or more generally [products](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/draft-2faab89a-3e8d-4d42-ada3-73d69511104f){:target="_blank"}. You can see some of my projects below.

I enjoy learning new technical concepts and technologies while working on professional projects.

Feel free to [reach out](/contact) !
